            Supply Rush has me hooked! The balance between building your factory and keeping your
            hero alive is so satisfying. Every upgrade feels impactful, and the idle progression is
            perfect for quick sessions or deep dives
          </p>

            Finally, an idle game that truly challenges your strategic thinking! Optimizing my
            production line to keep up with the enemy waves is incredibly engaging. It's easy to
            pick up but has tons of depth

            I love how the game ties your factory management directly to combat. You really feel the
            impact of your decisions. It can get intense, especially when new enemy types appear,
            but that's what makes it so fun!

            The visual design of the factories and the combat are great. The constant need to adapt
            your supply chain to new challenges keeps you thinking. A must-play for strategy fans!

            If you enjoy optimization games, this is for you. Building efficient production lines is
            incredibly rewarding, and the hero combat adds a fantastic layer to the gameplay. Highly
            recommended!

            Supply Rush is surprisingly addictive. The progression system is well-paced, and there's
            always something new to unlock or optimize. Itâ€™s a brilliant blend of idle mechanics and
            strategic depth
